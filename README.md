# JavaScriptRefresher
A small project refresher on js functions, parameters, conditionals, and operator selectors

## Part 1: Calculator Frenzy
### You will be creating a function that can either, add, multiply, subtract, or divide

### JavaScript
- Create a function called `calculator()`
- This functions will take three parameters: `operator`, `num1`, and `num2`
- The first parameter, `operator` takes in a *string* that determines what mathematical operation to run (ex. addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- The second and third parameter, `num1` and `num2`, are any two numbers that will follow a mathematical operation based on parameter one
- This function should also take five conditional statements that run depending on the first parameter `operator`
- Create a variable named `output`
- `output` will be the number returned from the function
- console.log `output` at the end of the function
- To test your function, invoke `calculator()` with three parameters

## Part 2: Alien Annihilation
### You will create a function that returns a message depending on the conditionals fulfilled

###JavaScript
- Underneath the `calculator()` function create a new functione called `aliens()`
- The total amount of aliens there are is 10,000.
- Create variables with this information, and set up a series of conditional statements such that:
- First, check if there are 10,000 aliens. Then, if there are more than 5,000 green aliens, console.log "MOTHER OF GOD, not the green ones"
- If there are more than a total of 8,000 green and red aliens combined, console.log "DOOOOOM"
- If there are not more than 3000 red and blue aliens combined, console.log
- "We will not go quietly into the night. We will not vanish without a fight. TODAY WE CELEBRATE OUR INDEPENDANCE DAY!"
- You may assign the alien amounts yourself, but the total must add up to ten thousand!
